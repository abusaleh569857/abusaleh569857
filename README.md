Hi, I'm Abusaleh Alam Khan, a CSE student at United International University with a passion for web development and technology. I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have worked with frameworks like React, Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, and JWT for building dynamic and scalable applications. Currently, I’m diving deeper into the Next.js framework, Redux, Framer Motion, and learning about Docker to enhance my development skills and workflows. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and continuously improve my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of web development.



Skills: C / C++ / Java / Python / PHP / HTML5 / CSS3 / Tailwind CSS / Javascript / React / Node.js / Express.js / MongoDB / MySQL
